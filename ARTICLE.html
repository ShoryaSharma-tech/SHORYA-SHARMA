        India has created history by successfully landing Chandrayaan-3 on the surface of the moon. 
        This makes India the fourth country in the world to achieve this milestone and the first 
        to land near the moon's south pole.

        The mission was launched by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) and aims to study 
        the moon's surface, soil, and resources. Scientists believe this will help in future 
        space research and missions.
